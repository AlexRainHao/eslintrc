# eslintrc

Just my [.eslintrc.cjs](./.eslintrc.cjs) on use for create tiny project, or do hot experiments

- `Vue3` only
- `Typescript` targted on
- ESLint flat config avoided
- Steal Rules as much as I can
- startup new project without lose time

## items

almost these rule stole from [element plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@element-plus/eslint-config), other plugin including

- prettier
- jsonc
- unicorn
- vue

## TL;DR

> Hope you'll have fun tossing around `eslint` instead of immersing yourself in writing code

```bash
 _____________
< Fuck ESLint >
 -------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
